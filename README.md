MicroLite.Extensions.Mvc
========================

_MicroLite.Extensions.Mvc_ is an extension to the MicroLite ORM Framework which allows integration with ASP.NET MVC.

It is easy to use MicroLite with ASP.NET MVC, simply supply your controller with a Session (`IAsyncSession` or `IAsyncReadOnlySession` .NET 4.5 + MVC 5) / (`ISession` or `IReadOnlySession` .NET 4.0 + MVC 4) and use it in your controller actions. However, using the MVC extension for MicroLite makes it even easier and contains some useful extras.

## Supported .NET Framework Versions

The NuGet Package contains binaries compiled against:

* .NET 4.0 (Full) and Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc 4.0.20710
* .NET 4.5 and Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc 5.0
